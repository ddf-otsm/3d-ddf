# Particle Explosion Test Scene (Simulated)

This is a placeholder file created because Blender is not available.

To create the actual scene:
1. Open Blender
2. Run: scripts/create_baseline_scenes.py
3. Save as: projects/explosion-test/blender_files/active/particle_explosion_v1.blend

Scene should contain:
- Fire particle emitter
- Smoke domain with volumetric material
- Proper physics settings
- Test render validation

Status: Placeholder created - requires Blender for actual scene creation

## üîç What to Look For

When comparing the images, note differences in:

### Floor/Ground
- [ ] Is there a visible floor in all versions?
- [ ] What is the floor texture/pattern?
- [ ] Is the checker pattern visible or subtle?
- [ ] Does the floor look professional or test-like?

### Explosions
- [ ] How realistic do the explosions look?
- [ ] Are they yellow/orange spheres or volumetric effects?
- [ ] Do they have proper fire/smoke appearance?
- [ ] What's the overall quality difference?

### Lighting
- [ ] Overall brightness level
- [ ] Color temperature (warm/cool)
- [ ] Shadow quality
- [ ] Ambient light vs. direct light ratio

### Dadosfera Text/Logo
- [ ] Material quality (metallic, glossy, etc.)
- [ ] Readability
- [ ] Integration with the scene
- [ ] Any material differences?

### Camera & Composition
- [ ] Same angle in all renders?
- [ ] Depth of field effects
- [ ] Frame composition

### Overall Quality
- [ ] Professional appearance
- [ ] Polish level
- [ ] Production-ready?

## üéØ Key Question

**What is the ACTUAL difference that makes Oct 2 "good"?**

All dadosfera blend files have the SAME Ground_Plane with checker texture, so the floor material was always the same. The difference must be something else:

1. **Render settings?** (samples, denoise, exposure)
2. **Lighting?** (world settings, light strength)
3. **Camera?** (angle, focal length, DOF)
4. **Explosions?** (different objects, animation timing)
5. **Post-processing?** (compositing, color grading)
6. **Frame selection?** (viewing different moments)

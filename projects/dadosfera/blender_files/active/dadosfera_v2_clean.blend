# Dadosfera v2 Clean Scene (Simulated)

This is a placeholder file created because Blender is not available.

To create the actual scene:
1. Open Blender
2. Run: scripts/create_baseline_scenes.py
3. Save as: projects/dadosfera/blender_files/active/dadosfera_v2_clean.blend

Scene should contain:
- Dadosfera 3D text with metallic material
- Studio floor with PBR material
- 3-point lighting setup
- Professional camera setup
- No explosion objects (add later)

Status: Placeholder created - requires Blender for actual scene creation

# Archived V1 Files

**Archived on**: 2025-10-07 18:30  
**Reason**: Starting fresh with improved approach

## Files Archived

These files represented the first attempt at the Dadosfera animation, but had several issues:
- Simple geometry-based "explosions" (not real particle systems)
- Checker texture floor (not professional looking)
- Basic lighting setup

## What Was Learned

✓ Initial composition and camera angles  
✓ Dadosfera text/logo 3D model  
✓ Animation timing basics  
✗ Explosion approach was too simple  
✗ Materials needed improvement  
✗ Lighting needed professional setup  

## New Approach (V2)

See `../active/dadosfera_v2_clean.blend` for the fresh start with:
- Real particle-based explosions
- Professional PBR materials
- Studio-quality lighting
- Clean, optimized scene structure

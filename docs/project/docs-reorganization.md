# Documentation Reorganization (October 2, 2025)

## Summary

Restructured all documentation into a clean, standardized taxonomy under `docs/` and implemented validation to prevent future documentation sprawl.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                          # Documentation index (NEW)
├── project/                           # Project planning & history (NEW)
│   ├── roadmap.md                     # Moved from ROADMAP.md
│   ├── backlog.md                     # Moved from BACKLOG.md
│   ├── release.md                     # Moved from RELEASE.md
│   ├── overview.md                    # Moved from documentation/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
│   ├── reorganization-summary.md      # Moved from REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
│   ├── photorealistic-fix.md          # Moved from PHOTOREALISTIC_FIX.md
│   └── render-service-consolidation.md # Moved from RENDER_SERVICE_CONSOLIDATION.md
├── guides/                            # User guides (existing)
│   ├── blender-mcp-usage.md
│   └── rendering-guide.md
└── setup/                             # Installation (existing)
    ├── installation.md
    └── troubleshooting.md
```

### 2. Files Moved

| Old Location | New Location | Reason |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| `ROADMAP.md` | `docs/project/roadmap.md` | Consolidate project planning |
| `BACKLOG.md` | `docs/project/backlog.md` | Consolidate project planning |
| `RELEASE.md` | `docs/project/release.md` | Consolidate project planning |
| `documentation/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` | `docs/project/overview.md` | Remove duplicate folder |
| `REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` | `docs/project/reorganization-summary.md` | Organize project history |
| `PHOTOREALISTIC_FIX.md` | `docs/project/photorealistic-fix.md` | Organize project history |
| `RENDER_SERVICE_CONSOLIDATION.md` | `docs/project/render-service-consolidation.md` | Organize project history |

### 3. Directories Removed

- ❌ `documentation/` - Clear duplication of `docs/`

### 4. Updated References

All internal links in the following files were updated to point to new locations:
- `README.md`
- `docs/project/roadmap.md`
- `docs/project/backlog.md`
- `docs/project/release.md`

### 5. Validation System Created

#### Validation Script
**Location**: `scripts/validate_docs.py`

**Features**:
- ✅ Validates documentation structure
- ✅ Detects unauthorized root-level `.md` files
- ✅ Detects disallowed directories (`documentation/`, `doc/`)
- ✅ Verifies required `docs/` subdirectories exist
- ✅ Provides clear error messages with fix suggestions
- ✅ Can be run standalone or as a git hook

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
```

#### Git Pre-commit Hook
**Location**: `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`

**Features**:
- 🔒 Blocks commits that violate documentation structure
- 🔍 Runs validation automatically before each commit
- 💡 Provides clear error messages and fix suggestions
- ⚠️ Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` (not recommended)

**Installation**:
```bash
# Automatic
./scripts/hooks/install.sh

# Manual
cp scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Taxonomy Rules

### ✅ Allowed Root-Level Markdown Files
Only these files are permitted in the repository root:
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick setup guide
- `LICENSE.md` - License information
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines

### ✅ Required Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── project/     # Roadmap, backlog, releases, project history
├── guides/      # User guides and tutorials
└── setup/       # Installation and troubleshooting
```

### ✅ Allowed Other Locations
- `projects/{name}/*.md` - Project-specific documentation
- `scripts/*/README.md` - Component-level README files
- `tests/README.md` - Test documentation
- `blender-mcp/**/*.md` - Submodule documentation (excluded)

### ❌ Disallowed Patterns
- Root-level `.md` files (except allowed list)
- `documentation/` folder (use `docs/` instead)
- `doc/` folder (inconsistent naming)
- Orphaned `.md` files in unexpected locations

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All documentation lives under `docs/`
2. **Clear Organization**: Logical subdirectories for different doc types
3. **Automated Validation**: Pre-commit hook prevents structure violations
4. **Easy Discovery**: `docs/README.md` serves as documentation index
5. **Consistent Links**: All cross-references updated to new structure
6. **No Duplication**: Eliminated `documentation/` vs `docs/` confusion

## Testing

Validation passes successfully:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/validate_docs.py

======================================================================
📋 Documentation Structure Validation
======================================================================

✅ Found 12 documentation files in docs/

======================================================================
✅ Validation PASSED - Documentation structure is correct!
======================================================================
```

## Migration Guide

### For New Documentation

**Before** (❌ Wrong):
```bash
touch MY_FEATURE.md  # Root-level file
```

**After** (✅ Correct):
```bash
# Determine the right location:
touch docs/project/my-feature.md       # Project planning/history
touch docs/guides/my-feature.md        # User guide
touch docs/setup/my-feature.md         # Setup/installation
touch projects/myproject/my-feature.md # Project-specific
```

### For Existing Projects

If you have documentation in the wrong place:

1. Run validation to find issues:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
   ```

2. Move files as suggested:
   ```bash
   # Example
   mv MY_DOC.md docs/project/my-doc.md
   ```

3. Update any references in other files

4. Re-run validation to confirm:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more validation rules (e.g., check for broken links)
2. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
3. Add auto-fix capability to validation script
4. Generate documentation sitemap automatically
5. Add documentation coverage metrics

**Completed**: October 2, 2025
**Impact**: 7 files moved, 1 directory removed, validation system added
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All documentation properly organized

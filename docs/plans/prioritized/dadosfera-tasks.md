## üö® Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
1. **Explosion Integration Validation** (P0, Task #2)
   - **Impact**: Blocks end-to-end demo
   - **Resolution**: Complete `projects/explosion-test/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - **ETA**: 2-3 days

### Risks
1. **Render Performance** (Medium Risk)
   - May exceed 20s/frame with complex scenes
   - **Mitigation**: Use quick quality for previews, optimize materials
   
2. **API Scalability** (Low Risk)
   - Single-threaded renders may bottleneck
   - **Mitigation**: Queue system, background workers, cloud scaling

3. **Quality Consistency** (Medium Risk)
   - Different text lengths may require different camera/explosion settings
   - **Mitigation**: Test with diverse inputs, create adaptive logic

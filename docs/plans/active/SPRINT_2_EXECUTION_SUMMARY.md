- Clear path to environment-specific configuration

---

### **10. LOW_ci_lint_for_hardcoded_paths** ‚úÖ

**What Was Done**:
- Added new Jenkins pipeline stage: "Check Hardcoded Paths"
- Created `scripts/validate_paths.py` (203 lines)
  - Detects hardcoded `/Users/`, `/Applications/`, `C:\`, `/home/`, `${PROJECT_ROOT}` paths
  - Skips cache directories (.mypy_cache, .pytest_cache, etc.)
  - Skips example files (.env.example, AGENTS.md)
  - Checks markdown, Python, shell, JSON, YAML files
  - Provides context-aware exceptions (example blocks, .env references)
  - Outputs actionable recommendations
- Made script executable
- Updated `Jenkinsfile` with new validation stage

**Patterns Detected**:
- macOS user paths: `/Users/[username]`
- macOS app paths: `/Applications/...`
- Windows drive paths: `C:\...`
- Linux user paths: `/home/[username]`
- Specific directory names: `${PROJECT_ROOT}`

**Impact**:
- Prevents regressions on path portability
- Catches hardcoded paths before merge
- Educational (developers learn portable patterns)
- Low maintenance (runs automatically in CI)

**Known Issues Found** (for future cleanup):
- Several scripts still have hardcoded paths (documented for future sprint)
- Some example commands in docs could use ${PROJECT_ROOT}
- Integration tests may need path updates

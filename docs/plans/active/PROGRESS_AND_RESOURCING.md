# Progress Velocity & Resource Allocation (Last 2 Weeks)

## Scope Window
- Period: last 14 days ending today (subjective synthesis from repo docs and structure)

## Velocity Snapshot
- Commits in last 2 weeks: 30
- Explosions: steady enhancements in planning docs; code changes pending validation renders
- Logo-to-3D service: planning structure in place; initial API structure present; execution paused pending prioritization
- Workflows/Docs: improved run/test guides; active plan curation

## Blockers & Bottlenecks
- Blender environment availability for reliable headless runs
- Path portability consistency across all scripts and docs
- Missing job queue and progress reporting for long renders

## Allocation
- AI hours focus: planning, doc structuring, path audit, dependency mapping
- Human hours focus: environment setup, validation runs, Blender scene tweaks

## Next 2 Weeks Plan (Resource Split)
- Planning/Docs: 6 AI h / 4 Human h — finalize dependency map, project parity, modernization report
- Pipeline Execution Foundations: 4 AI h / 8 Human h — text-to-3D extrusion, render-service bridging
- Portability & CI: 2 AI h / 2 Human h — `.env.example`, lints for hardcoded paths

## Notes
- Replace this with automated metrics when commit analytics and CI timings are available.

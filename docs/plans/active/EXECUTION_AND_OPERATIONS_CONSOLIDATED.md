## Section A: Top 5 Plans Execution Summary (Consolidated)

Originally from: `TOP_5_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md`

Includes: Validation remediation, test stabilization, explosion validation readiness, dadosfera integration validation, logo-to-3D execution readiness, metrics, risks, and next actions.

- Validation remediation: JSON fixed, links/path issues reduced; CI checks active
- Tests: dependencies + Blender mocks in place; pass rate improving
- Explosion validation: script ready; pending Blender install
- Dadosfera integration: documented; depends on explosion validation
- Logo-to-3D: deps installed; execution pending Blender

See details and CLI examples in this document's Appendix: Commands.

## Section B: Sprint 2 Execution Summary (Consolidated)

Originally from: `SPRINT_2_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md`

Highlights:
- Validation checklist established for explosions; keyframes and criteria
- Dependency map expanded and linked across plans
- Project-level prioritized task lists created (dadosfera, explosion-test)
- Setup docs strengthened with .env guidance
- CI lint for hardcoded paths added

---

## Section C: Execution Summary — 2025-10-03 (Consolidated)

Originally from: `EXECUTION_SUMMARY_2025-10-03.md`

- Archived Phase 2-4 & Advanced plans and updated active plan structure
- Consolidated explosion docs into the single roadmap
- Path portability replacements across key docs/scripts
- Modernization report expanded with CVE and upgrade plans
- Setup guides updated with .env and platform specifics

---

## Section D: Conversation Actions — 2025-10-03 (Consolidated)

Originally from: `CONVERSATION_ACTIONS_2025-10-03.md`

- Repo hygiene, venv tooling, taxonomy validation, submodule cleanup captured
- Render workflow improvements and portability updates documented
- Next tasks: run Blender-based validations via CLI with `--` separator

---

## Section E: Render Status & Queue (Consolidated)

Originally from: `RENDER_STATUS.md`

- Current renders, queued production jobs, hardware settings
- Known issue (dadosfera yellow spheres) linked to integration work
- Generic `scripts/render_production.py` usage retained

---

## Section F: Progress Velocity & Resourcing (Consolidated)

Originally from: `PROGRESS_AND_RESOURCING.md`

- Velocity snapshot, blockers (Blender environment, path portability), allocation
- Next 2 weeks split across planning/docs, pipeline execution, portability/CI

---

## Section G: Path Migration Notes (Consolidated)

Originally from: `PATH_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

- Guidance and state for replacing hardcoded paths with `${PROJECT_ROOT}` and `$BLENDER`
- Validation steps via `scripts/validate_paths.py`

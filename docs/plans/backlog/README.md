# Backlog - Future Features & Enhancements

This directory contains features and capabilities that have been planned but moved to backlog to allow focus on core functionality.

## 📁 **Backlog Structure**

```
backlog/
├── README.md                           # This file
├── deployment-strategy.md             # Full deployment strategy (Docker, K8s, CI/CD)
└── [future-features].md               # Additional backlog items as needed
```

## 🎯 **Current Backlog Items**

### **Deployment Strategy** 📦
- **Status**: Backlogged for post-MVP implementation

- Cloud-native deployment options
- Multi-region deployment strategies
- Advanced monitoring and observability setups
